# VFDB_result_fetcher
Genome coordinates can be extracted for the ORFs of virulent factors and the variants of peptides falling within these ORFs can be fetched. Virulent factor class (VFclass), virulence factors and related genes details can be extracted for all the matched variants from VFDB (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/cgi-bin/VFs/v5/main.cgi).
